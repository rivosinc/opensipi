# OpenSIPI

OpenSIPI is an open-source platform used to automate signal integrity (SI) and power integrity (PI) related extractions.

## Description

OpenSIPI serves as a platform to read and parse input info that is needed to set up simulations, to generate scripts that can be run by the EDA tools, to launch and monitor simulations running through the EDA tools, to post-process the extracted results and to create reports. Currently, OpenSIPI is developed with a focus on S-parameter and DCR extraction.
While OpenSIPI is open-sourced free of charge, the supported back-end simulation solvers are still commercialized tools. The successful extraction of the desired results are subject to the availability of proper commercial licenses.

## Installation and update

Open a terminal or command window. Install or update the tool using the following command.
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/rivosinc/opensipi
```
